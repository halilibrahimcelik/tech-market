 [Website Link](https://tech-market.vercel.app/).


This  project aims to display demo e-commerce website. 

Techniques I have used in this project;

--For  authentication of the user; Firebase Authentication service.  You have option two option for registeration. you can either use Tech-market sign-up page or You can Also sign-in with your Google accunt as well. 

--If you forgot your password, you are also able to send reset link to your registered Email.

--I structured the applications's components by Using React.js

--In doing so, I have used  react-router-dom to display single page application(SPA)

--I have used custom react hooks to easily control the state management.

--Firestore store management constitute  the backend of the application.All data gathered by end-users stored in the firestore. 

--For styling, I adopted SCSS/SASS module. Each and every one of component and page has its own styling page.

--Other third party frameworks that I have used:

=> React Toastify (I used custom Toastify as well)

=>React Leaflet  components  for displaying  open sources mapping.

=>Swiper.js which I have used for creating touch sliders for products
